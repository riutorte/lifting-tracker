# XRSize4 ALL / Lifting Tracker — Kanban (Sprint 0c1)

Per CONVENTIONS_v0.2.3 §8 + §14.2, this is Sprint 0c1's per-sprint kanban. Created at sprint open with explicit open-items migration from `kanban-sprint-0c.md`. Frozen at sprint close as the immutable record.

## Sprint 0c1 — Documentation Hygiene + AV-2 Enrichment + First Prevention Action

**Theme:** Apply the v0.2.3 + v0.2.4 naming and convention rules portfolio-wide; land directory READMEs; close AV-2 to inclusion-completeness; ship the highest-yield failure-modes prevention action; deliver the wide/deep failure-modes + rollback strategy research.

**Dates:** 2026-04-28 → TBD (estimated 2-4 days under solo+AI; over-scoped at 10 close criteria, may run longer)

**Goal:** Portfolio-wide naming convention applied; directory READMEs in place; AV-2 dictionary enriched to fit-for-purpose DoDAF compliance; first failure-modes prevention action shipped (deny list); rollback strategy research delivered.

**Close criteria (10 items):**

1. ✅ INHERITED — CONVENTIONS_v0.2.3 §14.4 retros README discipline amendment landed (committed in Sprint 0c close commit; this kanban inherits as baseline)
2. NEW — Directory READMEs created: `docs/dodaf/README.md` (DoDAF view index + §11 reference), `docs/adrs/README.md` (ADR index + ADR template), `docs/conversation-archive/README.md` (date-organized index), `docs/README.md` (top-level docs/ overview)
3. ✅ INHERITED — Retros README rename + index landed (committed in Sprint 0c close commit; this kanban inherits as baseline)
4. NEW — Naming-convention rename pass: apply `lift-track-` prefix to ~25 system-specific files. Includes:
   - `architecture_v0.4.0.md` → `lift-track-architecture_v0.4.0.md`
   - `roadmap_v0.4.0.md` → `lift-track-roadmap_v0.4.0.md`
   - `risks_v0.1.0.md` → `lift-track-risks_v0.1.0.md`
   - `metrics_v0.1.0.md` → `lift-track-metrics_v0.1.0.md`
   - `effort-estimate_v0.1.0.md` → `lift-track-effort-estimate_v0.1.0.md`
   - `ontology-plan_v0.1.0.md` → `lift-track-ontology-plan_v0.1.0.md`
   - `themes-epics-features_v0.2.0.md` → `lift-track-themes-epics-features_v0.2.0.md`
   - `user-stories_v0.2.0.md` → `lift-track-user-stories_v0.2.0.md`
   - `kanban-sprint-<id>.md` → `lift-track-kanban-sprint-<id>.md` (× all existing sprint kanbans)
   - `sprint-retro-<id>.md` → `lift-track-sprint-retro-<id>.md` (× all existing retros)
   - ADRs: `D##-<slug>_v<version>.md` → `lift-track-D##-<slug>_v<version>.md`
   - DoDAF views: `<view-code>-<slug>_v<version>.md` → `lift-track-dodaf-<view-code>-<slug>_v<version>.md`
   Plus cross-reference sweep across all active docs.
5. NEW — `source-doc-cm-design.md` rename to `lift-track-source-document-cm_v0.3.0.md` + ~140 cross-reference updates portfolio-wide
6. NEW — `dispatch-handoff.md` rename to `lift-track-dispatch-handoff_v0.1.0.md` + semver bump per §6.2 v0.2.3 amendment
7. ✅ INHERITED — `.gitignore` Obsidian additions × 2 repos (committed in Sprint 0c close commit; this kanban inherits as baseline)
8. NEW — AV-2 enrichment fit-for-purpose pass: inclusion-completeness across all 10 views, CARP/CARPO subset typing, four authoring rules applied (verb-object activities, no-and, synonym-collapse, bracketed-context-tag), domain concepts (Session, Exercise, Set, Limb Configuration, Volume, Rest Cascade, Goal, Progress Photo, etc.) added as standalone rows. ~8 hours per DoDAF research.
9. NEW — Project-level `.claude/settings.json` deny list across 3 repos (lifting-tracker, reach4all, Concept). Minimum set per failure-modes research §7-B: `rm -rf` variants, `git push --force`, `terraform destroy`, `supabase db reset`, `cat .env`, secret-pattern-blocking. ~1 hour, highest yield-to-cost prevention action.
10. NEW — Wide/deep failure-modes + rollback strategy research delivered: `claude-code-failure-modes-and-rollback-strategy-research.md` lands in reach4all (currently running, will land in 0c1). Supersedes prior failure-modes research doc. Target ~1500-2000 lines covering 30-50 documented incidents + comprehensive rollback playbooks for Eric's stack (Supabase PITR, file-system recovery, git history restoration, cloud-platform mistakes, MCP server compromise, secret leak rotation).

**Stretch (only if 1-10 land cleanly with capacity remaining):**

- DoDAF cross-reference matrix (`docs/dodaf-cross-reference.md`) per CONVENTIONS §11.6 promise
- Reach4All bindfs-residue cleanup (worktree branches, untracked `.claude/`)

## Open-items migration from Sprint 0c

Per §14.2 inheritance rule. Each Sprint 0c carry-forward evaluated.

### Bring forward to Sprint 0c1 (10 items, in scope per the close-criteria above)

| Item | Source | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| Directory READMEs | New, surfaced by Eric's review | Bring forward as 0c1 CC2 |
| Naming-convention rename pass | Sprint 0c1 original scope | Bring forward as 0c1 CC4 |
| source-doc-cm-design rename + cross-refs | Sprint 0b2 carryover | Bring forward as 0c1 CC5 |
| dispatch-handoff rename + semver bump | Sprint 0b2 carryover | Bring forward as 0c1 CC6 |
| AV-2 enrichment fit-for-purpose pass | New, from DoDAF research | Bring forward as 0c1 CC8 |
| `.claude/settings.json` deny list | New, from failure-modes research | Bring forward as 0c1 CC9 — highest yield |
| Wide/deep failure-modes + rollback research | New, from Eric's call to deepen the prior research | Bring forward as 0c1 CC10 (running) |

### Defer to Sprint 0c2 (2 items)

| Item | Source | Reason for defer |
|---|---|---|
| Default `--worktree` for Cowork/Dispatch Code-task spawns + shell alias | Failure-modes research §7-D | Behavior change to spawning pattern; implement after deny list lands and is validated |
| `destructive-operation-policy.md` | Failure-modes research §7-G | Policy doc; depends on deny list and worktree default to be operational first |

### Defer to Sprint 0d (3 items)

| Item | Source | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `~/document-cm/` skill scaffold | Originally Sprint 0c primary scope — deferred again | Remains the load-bearing skill build; once 0c1 + 0c2 cleanup lands, 0d can focus on it |
| `.cm/manifest.yaml` for Lifting Tracker | Originally Sprint 0c primary scope — deferred again | Companion to document-cm skill |
| STIG alignment doc | 0b backlog (G31), originally 0c primary | Per Q4 = C, lands in `~/document-cm/` repo once it stands up — depends on document-cm scaffold |

### Defer to Sprint 0e (3 streams)

| Item | Source | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Scheduler implementation + 17 cron-driven research tasks | Sprint 0e primary | Operational sensing capability; needs the cleanup to land first |
| Listener / sniffer architecture + first 3-5 listeners (Apple, Anthropic, vendor license watch) | Sprint 0e (folded in per Eric's call) | Event-driven sensing; complements scheduler |
| LLM research — model selection / fine-tuning / system-prompt strategy for unrestricted research extraction | Sprint 0e (added per Eric's call) | Researches LLM choice for the eventual local LLM build; aim is no external constraints on translation/research-pull quoting |

### Out-of-band / external (3 items, not sprint-bound)

| Item | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Hardware purchase decision | Eric | Deferred per Eric — likely post-WWDC if M5 lands |
| LLM cloud-rental validation phase setup (Lambda Labs ~$200, 60 days) | Eric | Pre-HW validation per LLM scoping research recommendation |
| Re-share `f0492d52` Claude.ai URL | Eric | Trivial; failed fetch from earlier research |
